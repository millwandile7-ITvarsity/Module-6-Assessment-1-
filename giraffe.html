                    <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
                    <p>The giraffe (Giraffa) is an African artiodactly mammals, the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant.
                    it is traditionally considered to be one species, Giraffa comelopardalis, with nine extant giraffe species has been described 
                    based upon research into the mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, as well as morphological measurements of Giraffa.Seven other prehistoric
                    species, known from fossils, are extinct.</p>
                    <p>The giraffes chief distinguishing characteristics are its extremely long neck and legs, its horn-like ossicones, and its distinctive 
                    coat patterns.it is classified under the family Giraffidea, along with its closest extant relative, the okapi.its scattered range extends
                    from Chad in the north to South Africa in the South, and from Niger in the west to Somalia in the east. Giraffes usually inhabit savannah 
                    and woodlands.Their food source is leaves, fruits and flowers of woody plants, primarily acacia species, which they browse at height most 
                    other herbivores cannot reach.</p>
                    <p>Lions,leopards,spotted hyenas and African wild dogs may prey upon giraffes. Giraffes live in herds of related females and their offspring 
                    or bachelor herds of unrelated adult males, but are gregarious and may gather in large aggregation. Males establish social hierarchies
                    through "necking", which are combat bouts where the neck is used as a weapon. Dominant males gain mating access to females, which bear the 
                    sole responsibility for raising the young.</p>
