                    <h3>ELEPHANTS</h3>
                    <p>Elephants are the largest existing land animals.Three living species are currently recognised: the African bush elephant, the African forest
                elephant, and the Asian elephant.They are an informal grouping within the proboscidean family Elephantidea.Elephantidea is the only surviving family of 
                proboscideans, extinct members include the mastodons.Elephantidea also contains several extinct groups, including the mammoths and straight-tusked elep-
                hants. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs, whereas Asian elephants have smaller ears, and convex or level backs.Distinctive features
                of all elephant include a long proboscis called a trunk, tusks, large ear flaps, massive legs, and though but sensitive skin.The trunk is used for 
                breathing, bringing food and water to the mouth, and grasping objects.Tusks, which are derived from the incisor teeth, serve both as weapons and as 
                tools for moving objects and digging.The large ear flaps assist in maintaining a constant body temperature as well as in communication.The pillar-like
                legs carry their great weight.</p>
                <p>Elephants are scattered throughout sub-saharan Africa, and South Asia, Southeast Asia and are found in different habitats, including savannahs,
                forests, deserts, and marshes.They are herbivorous, and they stay near water when it is accessible.They are considered to be keystone species, due 
                to the impact on their environments.Elephants have a fission-fusion society, in which multiple family groups come together to socialise.Females(cow)
                tend to live in family groups, which can consist of one female with her calves or several related females with offspring.The groups, which do not include 
                bulls, are usually led by oldest cow, know as the matriarch.</p> 
                <p>Males (bulls) leave their family groups when they reach puberty and may live alone or with other males.Adult bulls mostly interact with family groups 
                when looking for a mate.They enter a state of increased testosterone and aggression known as musth, which helps them gain dominance over other males as
                well as reproductive success.Calves are the center of attention in their family groups and rely on their mothers for as long as three years.</p>
